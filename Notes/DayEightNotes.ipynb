    "## Socket Programming\n",

    "\n",
    "Socket Programming is simply using Python to set up a socket to enable network communcations!\n",

    "Client = requesting computer. Server = a remote server that waits to receive and service requests from the client (sorry for the circular definition!)\n",

    "Below, we will set up a very simple client-server connection using the local-host loopback IP. "
